DONNA

   Donna is experimental modern day chess engine implemented in Go. My primary
   goals were twofold: to gain more hands-on experience with Go and to learn
   about chess programming.

   Donna engine comes with interactive command line shell and supports standard
   UCI protocol. Its technical features include:

   Data Structures
      - Magic bitboards
      - Transposition table
      - Material imbalance table
      - Pawn cache

   Move Generation
      - All possible and all valid moves
      - Captures and pawn promotions
      - Checks and check evasions

   Search
      - Root, tree, and quiescence searches
      - Aspiration windows
      - Iterative deepening
      - Search depth extensions
      - Alpha/beta pruning
      - Mate distance pruning
      - Razoring
      - Futility margin pruning
      - Null move pruning
      - Late move reduction
      - Delta pruning for captures
      - Good and killer move heuristics
      - Insufficient material and repetition detection

   Position Evaluation
      - Piece/square bonuses
      - Material with imbalance adjustment
      - King safety and pawn shield quality
      - Castling rights
      - Piece mobility
      - Control of the center
      - Threats and hanging pieces
      - Passed, isolated, doubled, and backwards pawns
      - Trapped rooks and bishops
      - Known and lesser known endgames
      - Bitbase for King + Pawn vs. King endgames

   Game Controls
      - Maximum search depth
      - Time to make a move
      - Time control for certain number of moves
      - Time increment

   Other
      - UCI protocol support
      - Interactive read–eval–print loop (REPL)
      - Polyglot opening books
      - Test suite with 300+ tests
      - Donna Chess Format to define a position in human-readable way

THANK YOU!

   Chess programming in Go turned out to be a fascinating journey. I have never
   developed chess software before, and to learn more about it I studied all
   open source chess programs I could find. Donna stands on the shoulders of
   chess programming giants and it would never have been possible without them.
   My sincere admiration and gratitude goes to:

   - Aaron Becker, Daydreamer
   - Fabien Letouzey, Senpai
   - Igor Korshunov, Murka
   - Jon Dart, Arasan
   - Steve Maughan, Maverick
   - Tom Kerrigan, TSCP
   - Tord Romstad, Marco Costalba, and Joona Kiiski, Stockfish
   - Vadim Demichev, Gull
   - Vladimir Medvedev, GreKo

PERFORMANCE

   I have made every attempt to maximize the performance and minimize penalties
   imposed by Go garbage collector. On 1.3 GHz Intel Core i5 MacBook Air Donna
   evaluates around 550K positions per second in the middle game, and the number
   goes up to ~800K towards the endgame.

   Go is relatively new programming language and each point release typically
   boosts Donna's performance by 15-20%. Minor updates usually improve
   performance by another 5%.

STRENGTH

   On short time controls Donna exhibits strength around ELO 2500. Based on 200
   game matches  played by Donna vs. GreKo and Donna vs. Daydreamer 1.75 Ordo
   (https://sites.google.com/site/gaviotachessengine/ordo) rates Donna's
   performance as follows:

   PLAYER             : RATING    POINTS  PLAYED    (%)
   GreKo 12.0         : 2539.0      95.0     200   47.5%   ( +79,  =32,  -89)
   Donna 0.9          : 2556.5     105.0     200   52.5%   ( +89,  =32,  -79)

   PLAYER             : RATING    POINTS  PLAYED    (%)
   Daydreamer 1.75    : 2683.0     142.0     200   71.0%   ( +121, =42,  -37)
   Donna 0.9          : 2526.1      58.0     200   29.0%   (  +37, =42, -121)

   All games were played on MacBook Air 1.3GHz Intel Core i5 with 1 min. for
   40 moves + 1 sec. increment time control using most frequent lines opening
   book (scripts/mfl.epd). When running benchmarks to find the best move in
   known test positions Donna's results are as follows (10 sec. per position):

   "1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate" by Fred Reinfeld:   +918  -83  (91.7%)
   "Win at Chess" by Fred Reinfeld:                       +273  -27  (91.0%)
   "Silent but Deadly" by Dann Corbit:                    +112  -12  (91.0%)

DEDICATION

   Donna chess engine is dedicated to Lithuanian grandmaster Donatas Lapienis,
   the man who taught me how to play chess, among other things. In the mid
   1970's (pre-computer era), Donatas was the highest ranking correspondence
   chess player in the world with ELO rating of 2715.

   Special thanks goes to my old time buddy grandmaster Eduardas Rozentalis who
   inspired me to develop a chess engine.
